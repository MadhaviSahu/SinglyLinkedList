  -method to add a new node after this node
  -Accessor method to get a reference to the next node after this node
  -method to copy a list
  -recursive method to copy a list
  -method to Copy a list, returning both a head and tail reference for the copy
  -method to Compute the number of nodes in a linked list
  -method to Compute the number of nodes in a linked list in a recursive loop
  -method to Copy part of a list, providing a head and tail reference for the new copy
  -method to Find a node at a specified position in a linked list
  -method to Search for a particular piece of data in a linked list
  -method to remove the node after this node
  -method to set the data in this node
  -method to set the link to the next node after this node
